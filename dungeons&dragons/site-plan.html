          What Is It?
        <br>Dungeons and Dragons is a Table-Top RPG Game. RPG stands for Role Playing Game. You create a character and adventure into what is known as the multiverse where you will accomplish multiple tasks.
          <br>Who Can Play?
        <br>Dungeons and Dragons is the Number One Tabletop RPG game in the world. Where everyone from your 8 year old son to your 83 year old grandfather, can create a character and embark on the journey of their lives. There's room for all and fun for all.
          <br>Editions & Which To Play
        <br>Dungeons and Dragons has five different editions and is coming out with a sixth one eventually. Some of the best rated editions are the 3/3.5th edition and the 5th edition. Some Editions have a .5 because they were updated partially but not enough for a new edition. The 3.5th edition is currently considered the best Edition giving you the most character creation choices and more control on your skill path. However, it's also considered to be one of the hardest ones to learn, because of all of the choices you have before you and how easily it can cripple your character. The 5th Edition is the second best, but when showing people the game takes top spot due to it's simple and effective way of teaching the game but still enough choices in terms of character creation to not feel limited and repetitive when you make multiple characters. You can choose any Edition theoretically, if you have the books, but the 5th Edition is where most people are recommended to start.

      <h3>5th Edition</h3>
      <p>
        Fifth Edition
        <br>You have chosen the Fifth Edition! Congratulations. This is a wonderful game consisting of great lore, adventure, mystery, battle, and more. Here you will learn all about the Fifth Edition, its books, its characters, and more.
        <br>In order to play this game and this edition, one must have the Player's Handbook, the DM's Guide, and the Monster Manual. 
        <br>The Players Handbook
        <br>The player's handbook has everything you pretty much need for character creation. There it will teach you how to create your character and give him/her gear such as armor, weapons, potions, and more.
        <br>The DM's Guide
        <br>The DM's Guide is for your DM or Dungeon Master. He/Her sits slightly away from everyone so everyone can see and hear him but can't see the information in front of Him/Her. His role in the game is different from everyone else. He/Her doesn't have a character. The role of the Dungeon Master is like a Narrator. The DM is in control of the world and the monsters and anything that happens to the players. The DM creates a campaign or uses a pre-published one, and explains everything to the players such as where they are, what they are doing, and then plays out everything that happens.
        <br>The Monster Manual
        <br>The Monster Manual is also for the DM because it is a whole book on the monsters, monstrosities, oozes, trolls, giants, etc. Without this book, the party doesn't really have anyone to fight. Just aimlessly wandering around finding things with no resistance.

      <h3>3.5th Edition</h3>
      <p>
        3.5th Edition
        <br>You have chosen the 3.5th Edition! Congratulations. This is a wonderful game consisting of great lore, adventure, mystery, battle, and more. Here you will learn all about the 3.5th Edition, its books, its characters, and more.
        <br>In terms of books 3.5th Edition is the same. You still need the three main books, The Player's Handbook for character creation, the DM's guide for game creation, and the Monster Manual for challenges in your adventure.
        <br>The Players Handbook
        <br>The player's handbook will help you through character creation. You MUST have this book, especially if you've never played before. The 3.5th edition is the most complex of the five editions, but definitely the most fun. 
        <br>The DM's Guide
        <br>This book helps the DM or the Dungeon Master, who's basically the narrator of your campaign and your adventure, basically create an adventure. Here the DM will get information and tips/tricks on how to make an adventure as well as all the loot such as magical items, potions, etc. to give to the party.
        <br>The Monster Manual
        <br>This book is also for the DM. It holds a lot of monsters and there own 'character sheets' if you will, also known as stat blocks. This book is needed, because when you're wading through the sickly bog and a ghoul springs out of the muck grabbing your wizard by the ankle and pulling him into the bog. When your fighter's turn happens and He/Her wants to bash the ghouls skull in you need to know its protection and its health in order to know how much damage the Fighter does and if the ghoul dies etc.
