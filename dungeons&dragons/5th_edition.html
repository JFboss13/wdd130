            <p class="paragraph">In Dungeons & Dragons, the players form an adventuring party who explore fantasy worlds together as they embark on epic quests and level up in experience. The Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) is the game's referee and  storyteller. There's no winning or losing in D&D—at least, not in the conventional way. Dungeons & DragonsAt its heart, D&D is a game that focuses on storytelling. The dice just help you along. Everything is your decision, from what you look like, to how you act, to what happens next. The collective creativity in your D&D game builds stories that you'll tell again and again—ranging from the stuff of legend to absurd incidents that'll make you laugh years later. Have fun and remember the golden rule—never split the party!</p>

            <p class="info">The standard 5e Character Sheet is organized with some crucial but basic information at the top of the page. Your character's name, race, class, level and who is playing that character can all be found here, along with alignment (your character's ethical and moral outlook) and experience points.</p>
            <p class="info_one">In Dungeons & Dragons, one person serves as the Dungeon Master (or "DM"), the game's lead storyteller and referee. The DM runs the adventure for the players, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. Remember what the DM says goes, no arguing!</p>
            <p class="info_two">The core rulebooks are the essentials. You'll find these at just about any D&D table and they are worth the investment. You will likely find yourself coming back time and time again to check the rules included in these. The three core rulebooks are; The Players Handbook, The DM's Guid, and The Monster Manual.</p>
